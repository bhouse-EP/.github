Elastic Path powers mission-critical digital commerce for the world’s leading brands, such as Intuit, Pella, Serena & Lily, T-Mobile, and over 250 other [leading enterprises](https://www.elasticpath.com/case-studies?utm_source=github&utm_medium=profile&utm_campaign=22q4-standard-prospect-all-global-github-profile).  Our mission is to break through the barriers that prevent commerce leaders from delivering extraordinary shopping experiences. Today, that means making [composable commerce](https://www.elasticpath.com/composable-commerce?utm_source=github&utm_medium=profile&utm_campaign=22q4-standard-prospect-all-global-github-profile) accessible to all brands by reducing the cost, time, and overall risk of implementing and managing a multi-vendor approach. With Elastic Path, both business and tech teams are able to innovate on their own terms, fully embrace composability, and in turn, never compromise on what’s possible.
